### 🧪 Run Examples
**Coming soon**
 
## 💡 Usage Tips
- To achieve optimal results, you must run the game in **1600x900** resolution
- Remember to run the function switch_to_toram()
- You can accelerate the process by modifying the argument duration in module/core/cursor.py
- When import anything from module/core if Toram Online is not open then it will automically open Toram Online from Steam

## ❌ Limitations and Suggestions
⚠️ Note: The project currently uses template matching, which is scale-variant. Therefore, it is recommended to run the game at 1600x900 resolution for best results.

🎮 Compatibility: The current implementation only supports launching Toram Online via Steam. Asobimo launcher is not supported at this time.

🖼️ Troubleshooting: If the graphic module fails to recognize images correctly, you can retake all images in the asset/images/ folder. This usually resolves matching issues.
